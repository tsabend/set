<p class="h3">
  Creating page layouts in Basscss is incredibly fast and flexible.
  This guide will walk you through common layout patterns to create an entire page with a basic information hierarchy.
  To see what’s in this guide, check out the
  <a href="/docs/guides/layout/demo">demo</a>
  before you start, or just jump right in.
</p>

<section id="global-navigation" class="py2">
  <h1>Global Navigation</h1>
  <p>
    To start off, make a global navigation using the grid system and other utilities.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('global-navigation.html') }}
  <p>
    For the navigation links, use button styles to provide large hit targets
    and a consistent visual spacing.
    Use the margin and padding utilities to fine tune the spacing.
    The left side uses the <code>.sm-col</code> class to float left above the small breakpoint.
    The right side uses <code>.sm-col-right</code>.
    By not defining a column width, each side will be as wide as its contents.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="hero-banner" class="py2">
  <h1>Hero Banner</h1>
  <p>
    Next create a hero banner using utility styles.
    Note: This example uses the optional <code>basscss-utility-headings</code> and 
    <code>basscss-background-images</code> utility modules for the large heading and background image.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('hero.html') }}
  <p>
    A combination of utility styles is all that’s needed to create this banner.
    To fine tune the placement of a background image in a banner,
    consider adjusting the source image or placing page-specific styles directly in the head of the document.
    Since this image will only be used on this one page and it’s fairly small,
    an inline style has been used.
    This is to help reduce the size of the stylesheet by not including one-off styles.
  </p>
  <p>
    After seeing the global navigation above the hero,
    try moving it into the banner and removing the background color for a different look.
    Move the padding for the banner content into a nested div to adjust the layout.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('hero-navigation.html') }}
</section>

<section id="three-up" class="py2">
  <h1>Three Up</h1>
  <p>
    Next, use the grid system to create a three-up row of features.
    Note the use of <code>sm-</code> prefixed grid utility styles that only work from the small breakpoint up.
    The row itself uses the <code>.mxn2</code> utility to compensate for each column’s <code>.px2</code> padding.
    To control the spacing of typographic elements, each heading has its bottom margin removed.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('three-up.html') }}
</section>

<section id="blog-teaser" class="py2">
  <h1>Blog Teaser</h1>
  <p>
    To showcase the latest posts from the blog, create a new section.
    Use the grid system to create a wide left column
    and a narrow right column for direct links to blog post categories.
    The columns have two different widths defined for the small and medium breakpoints.
    This makes the right column relatively smaller for larger viewports.
    Use the <code>.sm-show</code> responsive utility to hide the sidebar when the viewport is narrower
    than the small breakpoint.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('blog-teaser.html') }}
</section>

<section id="gallery" class="py2">
  <h1>Gallery</h1>
  <p>
    Next, create a thumbnail gallery with 12 images.
    Twelve is divisible by 6, 4, 3, and 2 so no widows will appear
    when dividing up the thumbnails by those numbers in our grid.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('gallery.html') }}
  <p>
    The display block utility is used on the links and images to control spacing,
    and each thumbnail uses <code>.mb3</code> to keep the vertical spacing equal to the gutters.
    Although it’s unnecessary for images of the same dimension,
    clearfix elements with responsive utilities are used to ensure each column wraps at the appropriate point.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="footer" class="py2">
  <h1>Footer</h1>
  <p>
    Finally, create a footer with a dark background that fills the width of the viewport.
    Note the container is placed inside the footer element to control max-width.
  </p>
  {{ macros.example('footer.html') }}
</section>

<section id="conclusion" class="py2">
  <p class="h3">
    At this point, you should have created a page resembling the
    <a href="/docs/guides/layout/demo">demo</a>.
